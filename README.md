Part-1 
One of the key drivers of success for a hyperlocal firm is it’s Delivery fleet. Availability of Delivery 
partners on the platform is of paramount importance. 
The firm is trying to design a Benefit program where the partners would be given certain points on 
the basis of the duration of their availability on the platform (Supply Hours). The objective of 
designing such a program is to incentivize the partners over and above their regular payout so as 
they feel motivated to be present on the platform for longer hours. Though the requirement of 
partners for longer durations is maximum on (Sunday & Monday) ; followed by (Friday & Saturday) 
and then (Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday) ; the firm would ideally like a situation where a partner 
is consistently present on the platform throughout the week. 
DATA 
Attached in the excel named - “Partner Data” you would find the data for a company’s delivery fleet 
for a particular city (Sheet-1). 
Data Description 
Partner ID - ID of the Delivery Partner 
Date - Date 
Supply Hours - Number of hours the partner was online on the platform on that day 
Tasks - Number of deliveries the partner completed on that day 
Present a model on how would you design the Benefit Program. Since you are designing a program 
for a population earning 20-30 K a month please keep in mind that a very complicated point 
structure might be too difficult for them to comprehend which defeats the purpose of motivating 
the partners altogether. So, keep the model as lucid as possible. As you can understand, disbursal of 
points is an added cost to the company. You are expected to keep the Cost Metric - CPT (Cost per 
completed task) below 0.9 Rs. 
You are expected to share the following -
- Proposed Point Structure 
- Budget Summary (CPT Impact for all the 4 months)
